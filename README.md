# NatureOfCode
The code I wrote and the sketches I made while reading "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman. As a visual learner with a background
in design and art I highly recommend the book as it manages to explain complex topics in a fun and engaging manner.
### General info
Nature of Code is a book about simulating natural processes using programming. It explores a variety of topics, such as physics,
calculus, autonomous agents and computer graphics. The book uses Processing, which is a library available for Java, Python and JavaScript (as p5.js).
Although the code is written in Processing, it is readily adaptable to other languages. </br>
The processing website is here -> https://processing.org/
### Organization
The files are organized by chapter, with a misc folder where I put the code I wrote myself or through following tutorials
on YouTube. To run the sketches you need the processing IDE which is available on the website above.
